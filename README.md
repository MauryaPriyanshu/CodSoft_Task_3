## Project Name: ATM INTERFACE
## Description:

The ATM Simulator is a Java-based console application that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides a virtual environment for users to interact with their bank accounts, offering options to withdraw, deposit, and check account balances. This project aims to demonstrate the functionality of a basic ATM system and serves as an educational tool for learning about object-oriented programming and user input validation.

## Key Features:

1. User-friendly console-based interface for interacting with the ATM.
2. Options to withdraw, deposit, and check account balance.
3. Implementation of methods for each option: withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
4. A BankAccount class to represent the user's bank account and store account balances.
5. Validation of user input to ensure it falls within acceptable limits.
6. Informative messages for users based on the success or failure of transactions.
